Description: Interface to 'RogueNaRok' (Aberer et al. 2013) 
  <doi:10.1093/sysbio/sys078>.
  Rogue taxa are a class of taxa with uncertain position in a
  phylogenetic tree. For inference methods that yield a tree set (bootstrapping,
  Bayesian tree searches), rogue taxa can assume different positions for each
  tree. The presence of rogue taxa in a tree set can potentially remove all
  information from a consensus tree. The sum of branch support 
  values in a consensus tree can often be increased by removing rogue taxa.
