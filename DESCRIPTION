Description: Rogue ('wildcard') taxa are leaves with uncertain phylogenetic
  position.
  Their position may vary from tree to tree under inference methods that yield a
  tree set (e.g. bootstrapping, Bayesian tree searches, maximum parsimony).
  The presence of rogue taxa in a tree set can potentially remove all
  information from a consensus tree. The information content of a consensus
  tree - a function of its resolution and branch support values - can often be
  increased by removing rogue taxa. 
  'Rogue' provides an explicitly information-theoretic approach to rogue
  detection (Smith, forthcoming), and an interface to 'RogueNaRok'
  (Aberer et al. 2013) <doi:10.1093/sysbio/sys078>.
