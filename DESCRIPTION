Description: Interface to RogueNaRok <doi:10.1093/sysbio/sys078>.
  Rogue taxa are a class of taxa with uncertain position in a
  phylogenetic tree. For inference methods that yield a tree set (bootstrapping,
  Bayesian tree searches), rogue taxa can assume different positions for each
  tree. Theoretically, the presence of few rogue taxa in a tree set is 
  sufficient to render the consensus tree of this tree set devoid of any
  phylogenetic information. Practically, we can often improve the sum of
  branch support values in a consensus tree by removing rogue taxa.
