An R interface to [RogueNaRok](https://rnr.h-its.org/about),
an algorithm to prune rogue taxa and improve the resolution of phylogenetic
consensus trees (Aberer _et al._ 2013).

# Installation

Install and load the stable version from CRAN as normal:
```r
install.packages('Rogue')
library('Rogue')
```

Install the development version from GitHub as follows:
```r
devtools::install_github('ms609/Rogue')
library('Rogue')
```

The development version presently implements three heuristics for the
detection of rogue taxa.

- `RogueNaRok(trees)` detects rogue taxa using the RBIC criterion, using
  Aberer _et al_.'s 'RogueNaRok' implementation.

- `H1(trees)` and `H2(trees)` use the SPIC criterion and the heuristic
  search approaches described in Smith (forthcoming).
  
These functions will be fully described and documented before the next
CRAN release (and before acceptance of Smith, forthcoming).
